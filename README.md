# Keyboard Layout Fixer – Browser Extension
Keyboard Layout Fixer is a browser extension designed to quickly correct text typed in the wrong keyboard layout.

It allows you to seamlessly convert text between keyboard layouts directly inside:

You can convert either the entire text or just a selected fragment.
